Non-agentic 100% free & open source coding tool for AI-assisted programming.

Guiding Principles:

- initialize all popular chatbots
- do not track usage
- monetize only through donations
- stay robust, simple and lightweight (~1 MB)

CWC is for you if:

- you're an experienced developer working on a large codebase
- coding agents are too autonomous for your liking
- student or hobbyist on a budget

## You own the context

Other tools try to "guess" what pieces of the codebase matter for the given task, often struggling to get it right. They workaround this problem by overloading context with excessive information, hurting model's performance and your wallet.

CWC works differently:

- **You select** which folders and files are relevant to the task
- **You decide** what examples of coding conventions will work best
- **You know** exactly how much tokens you have in the context

The result? Unmatched in cost, speed and accuracy AI assistance.

> Too many tokens fighting for attention may _decrease_ performance due to being too "distracting", diffusing attention too broadly and decreasing a signal to noise ratio in the features. ~Andrej Karpathy

## Web chats

As everyone have their own favorite chatbot, each with unique features, feel and associated costs (with some being completely free!) CWC's core feature is prompt preparation (special context formatting using XML tags and instructions placement) for copy & paste and their hands-free initialization.

**The feature has two modes:**

- General - context and your instructions
- Code Completions - context, open editor with marked cursor position

Additional texts for model's guidance are fully adjustable in settings.

**_Apply Chat Response_** is a smart tool that automatically integrates chat responses with the codebase, either refactoring with API ("Truncated" edit format), replacing original files in place ("Whole" edit format) or patching with diffs ("Diff" edit format).

**Supported chatbots: (alphabetically)**

- AI Studio
- ChatGPT
- Claude
- DeepSeek
- Gemini
- Grok
- HuggingChat
- Mistral
- Open WebUI (self-hosted)
- OpenRouter Chat
- Qwen
- Yuanbao



The Connector extension is available in [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/gemini-coder-connector/ljookipcanaglfaocjbgdicfbdhhjffp) and [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gemini-coder-connector/).

> <small>**Legal Disclaimer:** After chat initialization, the extension does not read the incoming message. The injected _Apply response_ button is not a means of automatic output extraction, it's an alias for the original _copy to clipboard_ button.</small>

#### 🛠️ Code completions

Use any model for accurate code completions. The tool attaches selected context in each request.

#### 🛠️ File refactoring

Modify the active file based on natural language instructions. The tool attaches selected context in each request.

#### 🛠️ Apply chat response

Automatically integrate chat responses with your codebase. The tool detects whether the clipboard contains complete files (replaces them directly), diffs or truncated files with ellipsis commments, e.g. "// ..." (applies them intelligently).

#### 🛠️ Commit messages

Generate meaningful commit messages based on contents of affected files and diffs of changes.

## Quick start for chat

1. Open the new Code Web Chat view from the activity bar (sparkles icon).
2. Select folders and files to include in the context.
3. Enter instructions and copy generated prompt.
4. (optional) Install [browser integration](https://gemini-coder.netlify.app/docs/installation/web-browser-integration) for hands-free initializations.

## Quick start for code completions

1. Open the new Code Web Chat view from the activity bar (sparkles icon).
2. Select folders and files to include in the context.
3. Place caret where you want code completion to appear.
4. Use Command Palette (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P) and type "Code Completion".
5. Bind the command to a keyboard shortcut by opening Keyboard Shortcuts (Ctrl/Cmd+K Ctrl/Cmd+S), searching for `Code Web Chat: Code Completion`, clicking the + icon, and pressing your preferred key combination (e.g. Ctrl/Cmd+I).
