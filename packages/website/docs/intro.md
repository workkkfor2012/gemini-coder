# Introduction

Gemini Coder lets you conveniently copy folders and files for chatbots. With the Connector browser extension you can initalize them hands-free!

The extension uses the same context for built-in API features: **Fill-In-the-Middle (FIM) completions** and **file refactoring**. Hit **apply changes** to integrate AI responses with just a single click.

- **100% free & open source:** MIT License
- **Versitale:** Not limited to Gemini or AI Studio
- **Private:** Does not collect any usage data
- **Local:** Talks with the web browser via WebSockets
- **One of a kind**: Lets you use any website for context
- **Lightweight:** Unpacked build is just ~1MB

## You own the context

Other AI coding tools try to "guess" what context matters, often getting it wrong. Gemini Coder works differently:

- **You select** which folders and files provide relevant context
- **You control** what examples of coding conventions to include
- **You know** how much tokens is used in web chats and FIM/refactoring requests

The result? Unmatched in accuracy, speed and cost AI assistance.

> Too many tokens fighting for attention may _decrease_ performance due to being too "distracting", diffusing attention too broadly and decreasing a signal to noise ratio in the features. ~Andrej Karpathy
