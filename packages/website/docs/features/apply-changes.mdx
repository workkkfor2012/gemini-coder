# Apply changes

The feature helps you integrate AI-suggested changes to your codebase with a single click. Copy the full response (or just a single file block) to your clipboard, then return to VS Code and click the "Apply changes" button in the status bar (or use the corresponding command).

_Structure of the generated API request:_

```
<file>...</file> (Original file)
User requested refactor of a file. In your response send fully updated <file> only, without explanations or any other text.
[CODE BLOCK CONTENT]
```

Full responses targeting multiple files to be parsed correctly, code blocks must contain filenames in expected places. When initializing AI Studio through the Connector web browser extension we ask it to use "name" attribute in system instructions. The same format is supported by default in Github Copilot. The other format "first line comment" is commonly used by other supported chatbots not supporting system instructions like DeepSeek.

<Tabs groupId="apply-changes-1">
  <TabItem value="format" label='"name" attribute'>

````markdown
```typescript name=path/to/your/file.ts
Code content for the file goes here...
```
````

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="comment" label="First line comment">

````markdown
```typescript
// path/to/your/file.ts
Code content for the file goes here...
```
````

````markdown
```typescript
// Add this to path/to/your/file.ts
Code content for the file goes here...
```
````

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## How it Works

You copied...

<Tabs groupId="apply-changes-2">
  <TabItem value="format" label='whole response'>

     - Any text surrounding code blocks is discarded.
     - Each code block containing file name is extracted.
     - You'll be prompted to choose between **Intelligent update** and **Fast replace**
       - **Intelligent update**: For each file block found, the extension sends separate messages with the original file and the provided block content (treated as instructions/diff) to generate the fully updated file.
       - **Fast replace**: For each file block found, the content is used to overwrite an existing file. This mode is instantaneous but assumes each code block contains the complete, final content for each file.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="comment" label="single code block">
   - The extension sends a message with the active file content and the clipboard-stored code block.
   - Your active file is replaced with the AI-generated update.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Reverting Changes

If you're not satisfied with the changes applied, Gemini Coder provides a command to revert the last batch of changes:

- **Gemini Coder: Revert Last Applied Changes** - This command restores files to their state before the most recent application of changes:
  - For modified files, it restores their original content
  - For newly created files, it deletes them
  - Available in the Command Palette
  - Also available in a notification that appears immediately after applying changes

The revert functionality remembers the state of files before changes were applied, allowing you to safely experiment with AI-suggested modifications knowing you can easily undo them if needed.

## Available commands

##### `Gemini Coder: Apply Changes`

Applies changes to the current file using the default model.

##### `Gemini Coder: Apply Changes with...`

Lets you select which model to use for applying changes.

##### `Gemini Coder: Apply Changes (Fast replace)`

Applies changes using the fast replace mode, assuming clipboard contains complete file content.

##### `Gemini Coder: Apply Changes (Intelligent update)`

Applies changes using the intelligent update mode, which uses AI to merge changes intelligently.

##### `Gemini Coder: Revert Last Applied Changes`

Reverts files to their state before the last application of changes.

##### `Gemini Coder: Change Default Apply Changes Model`

Configure which model should be used as the default for applying changes.
