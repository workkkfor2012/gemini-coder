# Generate Commit Message

Gemini Coder's Generate Commit Message feature automatically creates meaningful commit messages. This saves you time and ensures your commit history remains descriptive and consistent.

_Structure of the generated message:_

```
<files>
  <file name="...">...</file> (Affected files)
  ...
</files>
[COMMIT MESSAGE PROMPT] (Write a brief and precise summary for the following diff, limited to a single sentence if possible. Use an imperative tone to ensure clarity and focus on the primary change or purpose.)
[DIFF OF CHANGES]
```

## Available commands

##### `Gemini Coder: Change Default Commit Message Model`

Configure which model should be used as the default for generating commit messages.

## Configuration

##### `geminiCoder.commitMessagePrompt`
